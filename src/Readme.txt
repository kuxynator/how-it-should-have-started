How It Should Have .. Started?!
====================


Jump straight to building your base with speedy construction bots! Super handy for those times when you have all the initial stuff planned out and don't want to spend time chopping down trees.

Adds custom construction bots, roboport and legs to the player when they join the game. All basic armor will get 3 slots and you can fit these custom items in even Light Armor!

These are equivalent to top tier equipment but cannot be built and will expire after you research (somewhat) equivelent levels. Will adjust technology if it detects bob's is present.


I designed this mod after starting yet another run with Bob's and wanting a mod that gave me the ability to build with freedom without screwing up the balance too much - biters should still be a challenge, just makes it easier to get around and build / copy / paste your base!


*** Note: You must start a new game (this is like a quick start) to get the custom items ***

*** By default you get no armor -- craft yourself some light armor and add the modules to it and you'll feel great! ***

Known Issues:
------------
 - Will not remove the custom items on research if they are not in players inventory when you do the research!
